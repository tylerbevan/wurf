.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBwurf\fP is a tool to copy files between hosts. It can
serve a specified file on HTTP,just for a given number of times, and then
shutdown. It can be easily used to share files across the computers on a
net, and given that the other ends should have just a browser, it can share
stuff between different operating system, or different devices (e.g.: a
smartphone). It can also show a simple html form in order to upload a file.

.SH FILES
You can specify different defaults in two locations: /etc/wurfrc
and ~/.wurfrc can be INI-style config files containing the default
port and the default count. The file in the home directory takes
precedence. The compression methods are "off", "gz", "bz2" or "zip".

    Sample file:

        [main]
        port = 8008
        count = 2
        ip = 127.0.0.1
        compressed = gz
        tls = on

        [tls]
        cert = /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem
        key = /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem
        keypass = my_password
